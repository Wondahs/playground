## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

Some major knowledge gained while working on this project include:

- Better understanding of CSS styling.
- Use of Regular Expressions(Regex) in JS.
- Selection of sibling elements in CSS using '+' and '~'.
- Use of Array functions such as .some(), .ForEach(), .All().
- Better understanding of DOM manipulation using JavaScript.

### Continued development

I still intend to include a proper email and phone number validator that ensures users put in proper data.
